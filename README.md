# It's my school project
# I personally developed a large portion of this project. 
# Due to my limited capabilities in design, I used ready-made resources for the main character and animations, the tile map, the background of EP1, and the designs of the bat character, which is an enemy. 
# All other components of the project were designed and developed by myself.
